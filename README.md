# Vector-RC
Remote Control App for Anki Vector

This is a Flask web app to control Anki's Vector robot - https://www.anki.com/en-gb/vector

this app is based on their app that ships with the SDK - https://github.com/anki/vector-python-sdk/tree/master/examples/apps/remote_control

I am just using their app to edit and learn and create my own in the process.

So far the controls are the same in mine as theirs, except I have added H to tell vector to go home.
